# Troubleshooting

## `Error: key not found: "clone_url"`

When running into the issue then a tab with the specified tag has been created locally and running the command again will result in 

```
Error: You need to bump this formula manually since the new version
and old version are both 0.5.2.
```

In this case you just run `brew update-reset && brew update` which shiuld remove the local tap and lets you run `brew bump-formula-pr` again.

## Manual bump

1. Update `tag` and `revision` in https://github.com/Blackjacx/homebrew-formulae/blob/main/Formula/asc.rb.
2. Create a PR with the title `Bump asc to version 0.5.2` and merge it.
